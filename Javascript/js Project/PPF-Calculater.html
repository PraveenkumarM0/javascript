                Why we are using PPF?
            </summary>
            <p>
                A Public provident fund scheme is ideal for individuals with a low risk appetite. Since this plan is mandated by the government,
                 it is backed up with guaranteed returns to protect the financial needs of the masses in India.

                What are the tax benefits of PPF?
            </summary>
            <p>
                PPFs have become a preferential investment option for many because of the tax benefits they provide. PPFs
                fall within the EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) category. Thus, with PPFs, you get triple tax exemptions under
                the Income Tax Act 1961. You can enjoy tax exemptions at the time of investing, accrual, and withdrawal.
                Under Section 80C of the Act, you can avail a deduction of up to INR 1.5 lakh in each financial year on a
                PPF. Plus, the interest you earn every year is also tax-exempt. Lastly, the corpus that you withdraw upon
                maturity is also exempt from tax.
